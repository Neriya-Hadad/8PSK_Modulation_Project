# 8PSK_Modulation_Project

This repository contains MATLAB code, simulation results, and a comprehensive report for a digital communication project focused on 8PSK modulation.

## Project Overview

- **Modulation Scheme:** 8PSK (8-Phase Shift Keying)
- **Topics Covered:**  
  - Theory and mathematical background  
  - Signal generation and constellation diagrams  
  - Simulation of noise effects  
  - Symbol and bit error rates (SER, BER)  
  - Filtering, synchronization, and phase noise  
  - System performance analysis

## Files Included

- `8PSK_Modulation_Project.pdf` &nbsp; &nbsp;ðŸ“„  
  *Full project summary and report (English, PDF)*

- MATLAB code files (`.m`)  
  *Simulation scripts for all system components and experiments*

## Quick Start

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the `.m` files in MATLAB.
3. Run the scripts to reproduce all figures and results from the report.
